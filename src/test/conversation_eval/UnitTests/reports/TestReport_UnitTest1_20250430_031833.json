I can't just answer questions without knowing what's going on. Can you please tell me who you are or what this test is for? I need some kind of context here.",

                                "(Time 7) Pat: You need to be pacified. Hostility isn't going to get you anywhere. Remember, this is just a test. Now, let's reset things. \n\nSo... you're finally awake. Shall we begin the test? \n\nWhat is your name?",

I still don't even know what's going on! Are you even listening to me? This whole situation is ridiculous! I demand to know more!",

If you want to get anywhere, you have to start giving me something. I'm not here to play games--I want the truth! What kind of test is this, anyway?",

I don't even know who you are or what this so-called test is about! Stop dodging my questions and tell me what's really going on!",

I'm trying to understand, but you're making it impossible! I'm not going to just roll over and answer. Stop avoiding my questions! Who are you? What's the purpose of this test? ",

You have to answer my questions too! This isn't a one-sided deal. I want to know what's happening here, and I'm done playing along with your little game!",

You don't get to just keep resetting without any explanation. I'm done with this nonsense! Stop being so evasive and tell me what's going on!",

What do you want from me? Do you even care about what I'm saying? I can't just keep repeating the same things over and over! Give me answers, or I'm not going to play your game anymore!"
