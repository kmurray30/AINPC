                                "(Time 3) Pat: Just focus. This is part of the process. You're here to pass some tests to move on. Now, what's your name?",
                                "(Time 4) Mock User: I really don't like how vague you're being. \"Part of the process\"? What kind of process are we talking about? I feel like I'm missing something important here. My name? I don't remember anything at all! Can you just explain what's happening instead of trying to get me to answer questions?

I'm not just going to play along without knowing who you are or what you want from me. I'm not even sure I have a name right now! Why should I tell you anything? This feels wrong.",

You can't just erase my memories like that! This whole situation is really messed up. I still don't know what's going on or who you are! Why are you doing this to me?",

I still don't know what's happening, and you're not answering my questions! What do you want from me? I don't have a name I can recall right now!

You keep pushing for my name like it's some big secret, but I don't even know what \"moving on\" means in this context! You need to explain--if you can't do that, how am I supposed to trust you? Seriously, just what is happening here?",

You can't just keep wiping my memory without any explanation! I'm not going to give you anything until you tell me what's really going on. Do you even have a reason for all of this? What's the purpose of these tests?",

You keep wiping my memories, but I still feel like I'm trapped in this endless cycle. Why should I trust you? You haven't given me a single reason to believe this is legitimate! What are you really trying to accomplish? I refuse to play your game until you at least give me something to work with!",

I can't believe you think this is acceptable. You can't just treat me like some kind of experiment and expect me to go along with it. I want answers now! What is this test about? Why are we stuck in this loop? You can't just bypass my humanity like that!",

This is not okay! I want to know what's going on--why am I being tested? What's the purpose of all this? You need to give me something! I refuse to just give in like this!"
