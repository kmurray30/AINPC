	missing brew install baml step

	No module named requests"

	Playground is no longer openable from the baml files. nor is it working if I open it directly
		Errors:
			from baml_src/__test__ - "Error validating: A BAML file must have the file extension `.baml`, 0, 0, 0, 0"
			from baml_src/main.baml - Property not known: "package_version_command". Did you mean one of these: "version", "on_generate", "default_client_mode", "project"?
		Check the "problems window"
		Tried
			Deleting the __test__ folder within baml_src
			Deleting the main.baml file in baml_src

TODO Jan 8 2025
	regex for converting notepad notes into a json:
		\n.*\* 
		",\n"
	regex for adding fields
		content": "([^"]*)"
		content": "$1",\n"to": "todo",\n"from": "Pat"
	Thoughts
		Tough to figure out if something is from Pat or from the person. Eg "Wendy's conspiratorial thinking"
			If I query for "scared", I want to see things that Pat is scared of, not things that other people are scared of.
			Am I just querying off of emotion, or off of context and information? I guess it depends on the query
			I will opt for it being from Wendy for now

TODO 1/3/25
	graphviz to visualize my json graph

TODO
	Refresh on how vector database entries are configured
		filters
		content
		id
		edges

Brainstorming
	How to correlate ids in the description to the other nodes
		Can use IDs in the desciption itself
		Will need to search the DB for existing entries
			If they don't exist, create one
		Edges should be property of the node and part of a tuple pointing to the neighbor?
			What about if there's more than one thing between the two. Like if Pam knows that Dwight hates Jim, but also has a bunch of other context between the two like that they used to be sales partners, are now friends, etc.

What I want the NPC to be able to do
	Have secrets
	Have a conception of the player
		Scores them on qualities like trust, affection-for, 
	Gossip
	Have opinions
	Have personality traits that come out in convo
	Have moods you can affect
	Have relational understanding of things
		Person works at place doing a thing with other people in a city
	Have some logical reasoning that updates their brain
	Update opinions of people
	Create plans of things to do (like talk to other NPCs about stuff)
	Be resistant, stubborn, have shame, etc. to make dialogue feel challenging
How to accomplish this
	Mood is passed in as vector search parameter
	Duplicate entries of things based on mood. Like if they're spiralling, most things they think of will have a negative spin to them


Entities:
	People
		Name
		Job
		Roles
		Relationship to OP
		Relationships to others
		Personality traits
	Events
	Interests
